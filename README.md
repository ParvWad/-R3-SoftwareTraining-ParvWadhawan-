For this project, I had to relearn a lot of arduino. I found that I had forgotten a significant amound of coding and syntax used by arduino after not having used it for upwards of a year. To relearn, I had watched a few youtube videos to learn the basic syntax and I also watched around an hour of the seminar hosted by the software lead (which I found to be very helpful and informative). Equipped with the knowledge I learnt from those sources I was able to code my program with almost no hiccups. To make the circuit design, something I found much easier than the coding, I started from placing an arduino and a motor driver. Then, I got the motor driver working with two motors both going in both directions. I then introduced the Dip Switch to control the directions of the motor. Then, I introduced the potentiometer. Through this process, I had one problem where I was unable to get any power to the motors, which caused me to restard. However, other than that small hiccup I was able to proceed with minimal difficulty. Overall, I believe that this project took me about 5 hours total to both learn all needed materials and to finish the actuall construction.
