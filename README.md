For this project, I had to relearn a lot of arduino. I found that I had forgotten a significant amound of coding and syntax used by arduino after not having sued it for upwards of a year. To relearn, I had watched a few youtube videos to learn the basic syntax and I also watched around an hour of the seminar hosted by the software lead (which I found to be very helpful and informative). To learn the circuit design I found much easier, as I had to just google the pinout for the motor driver and everything else was very intuitive for me. The pinout, I had some difficulty with and I was forced to restart once because of a mistake I was unable to identify. Other than that, I was able to do the actuall circuit building with relative ease. Overall though, I was able to finish all of this project and learning in about a bit under 5 hours.
